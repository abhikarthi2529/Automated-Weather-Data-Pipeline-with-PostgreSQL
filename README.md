# Automated-Weather-Data-Pipeline-with-PostgreSQL

**Main goal** of this project: Create a project that emulates what a data engineer would do in their job.

**Result**: Extracted weather data from the Open Meteo API, ingested it into an ETL pipeline, and loaded it into a PostgreSQL database. The entire workflow is automated using Prefect and is executed every midnight.
